This project is a map for ZO Magazine, a small online arts publication for which I'm currently doing some part-time work.

## <a name="approach">General Approach</a>

For my final project, I had several objectives:

* improve my git/github practices (**accomplished!**)
* create something simpler and less comprehensive so that I can focus on writing better code (**somewhat accomplished!**)
* bug fix on my own (**mostly accomplished!**)


##<a name="installation">Installation Instructions</a>
**Angular dependencies:** ui-router  
Instructions:  
1. Load source file in view.  
2. List ui-router as a dependency when instantiating app.

##<a name="bugs">Bugs</a>
|Bug/Hurdle|Fix|
|---|---|
|not sure how to assign own data to each country in map | discovered .data and wrote a for loop |
|Angular not realizing data had changed due to me writing native JS | discovered $scope.$apply|
|country names not displaying in correct order due to asynchronicity| sorted names on server side and resorted the country order when rendering on client side to match|
|render map function was being called only once in service, so map would not render again upon switching back to map view| ran to Jim at 11th hour |
|cannot use $scope.$apply in one case since Angular said $rootScope already in progress | haven't figured that one out yet |
